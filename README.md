# Similarity Metrics
Implementation of 8 similarity metrics in rust, with benchmarks:
 - Tanimoto Coefficient
 - Euclidean Distance
 - Hamming Distance
 - Dice Coefficient
 - Cosine Similarity
 - Russell-RAO Coefficient
 - Forbes Coefficient
 - Soergel Distance

Also contains utilities to load and process SMILES data into various fingerprints, and functions optimized for generating similarity measures on large amounts of data.
